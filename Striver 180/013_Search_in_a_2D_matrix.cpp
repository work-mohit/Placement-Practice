// Naive approach -: Traverse all the elements with two for loops O(N*N)

// Better approach -: since matrix is ordered ( it's like a sorted array just aligned into a matrix)
//                 check if target is in b/w first and last element of the row first <= ele <= last

// Best Approach : don't considered it as a matrix  just take care of the indices
